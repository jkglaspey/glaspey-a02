/*
    Create a simple program that validates user login credentials. The program must prompt the user for a username and
    password. The program should compare the password given by the user to a known password. If the password matches,
    the program should display "Welcome!" If it doesn't match, the program should display "I donâ€™t know you."


    Create method to determine if the string matches a known password
        boolean compare(String password, String s)
            return s.equals(password)

    Main method:
        declare variable for storing password (string)
        create random "known" password
        compare known to string
        if(the strings are equal)
            "Welcome!"
        else "I don't know you"
*/

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution15 {

    public static boolean compare(String known, String password) {
        return known.equals(password);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //declare variables
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        String password;
        String known = "abc$123";

        //gather data
        System.out.print("Enter the password: ");
        password = in.nextLine();

        //determine and print results
        if(compare(known,password))     System.out.print("Welcome!");
        else System.out.print("I don't know you.");
