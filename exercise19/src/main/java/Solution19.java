    Create a program to calculate the body mass index (BMI) for a person using the personâ€™s height in inches and weight
    in pounds. The program should prompt the user for weight and height.


    Create method to prompt user for weight
        int weight()
            loop
                print "What is your weight in pounds"
                if input is int, return int
                else
                    string dump = nextLine
                    continue

    Create method to prompt user for height
        int height()
            loop
                print "What is your height in inches"
                if input is int, return int
                else
                    string dump = nextLine
                    continue

     Create method to calculate BMI
        double BMI(int weight, int height)
            return ( (double) weight / (height * height )) * 703

     Create method to determine final output
        void print(double bmi)
            print "Your bmi is 'bmi'"
            if bmi > 25 print "You are overweight. You should see your doctor"
            else if bmi < 18.5 print "You are underweight. You should see your doctor"
            else print "You are within the ideal weight range."

     Main method:
        Create int's for weight and height
        weight = weight()
        height = height()
        Calculate BMI
            double bmi = bmi(weight, height)
        if
